# assignment 2


# 2. PLEASE WRITE A SMALL PROGRAM THAT REQUESTS (USING THE INPUT BUILTIN FUNCTION) VALUES FOR (P) (R) AND (T).
#  AND SOLVES THE SIMPLE INTEREST AND PRINTS THE VALUE. ALSO PRINT THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAYABLE AT END OF PERIOD.

# Simple Interest= P x R x T รท 100, where P = Principal, R = Rate of Interest and T = Time Period of the Loan/Deposit in years.
