Anybody wey wan fight you
Make them come
They already know
I'll be right beside you
Like the wall of Jericho
They don't know
They don't know
They don't know what's going on
Muna gi so
Muna gi so, muna gi so, my baby boo
I'll be a soldier for you
I'm getting better in kung-fu
You should know I got you
And you don't need to get me too
I'll be right beside you
In anything that you do
If you ever need saving
I will be running to
Running, running, running to you
I'll be running to you
Running, running, running to you
Anywhere that you go to
Running, running, running to you
I'll be running to you
Running. running. running to you
Anywhere that you go to
If they wanna be the pharoah
If they wanna be the Judas
Me I cannot lay low
Me I'll never do that
Now they know, now theyâ€¦
